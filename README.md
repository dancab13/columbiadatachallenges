This repo demonstrates my proficiency with using Microsoft Excel to analyze a large dataset to find trends within the data. I used conditional formatting to highlight relevant changes in data. I also used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to visualize various trends and findings. The included report analyses the findings and posits why certain crowdfunding projects are successful.

"Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends."

This repository contains an Excel workbook, a Word document, and this readme file.

All work and code is my own unless specified otherwise.
